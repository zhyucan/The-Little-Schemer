insertR* and rember* ask 3 questions

; The First Commandment
; (final version)
; When recurring on a list of atoms, lat,
; ask two questions about it: (null? lat) and else.
; When recurring on a number, n,
; ask two questions about it: (zero? n) and else
; When resurring on a list of S-expressions, l,
; ask 3 question about it: (null? l), (atom? (car l)), and else

insertR* and rember* are similar
if car is a list, recur the car and cdr

all *-functions are similar
ask 3 questions
if car is a list, recur the car and cdr

all *-functions work on lists that are either
  - empty
  - an atom consed onto a list, or
  - a list consed onto a list

; The Fourth Commandment
; (final version)
; Always change at least one argument while recurring.
; When recurring on a list of atoms, lat, use (cdr lat).
; When recurring on a number, n, use (sub1 n).
; And When recurring on a list of S-expressions, l, 
; use (car l) and (cdr l) if neither (null? l) nor (atom? (car l)) are true.
; 
; It must be changed to be closer to termination.
; The changing argument must be tested in the termination condition:
; when using cdr, test termination with null? and
; when using sub1, test termination with zero?.
